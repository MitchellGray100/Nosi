# Nosi

Nosi is an IDE created from adding functionality to a fork of vscode. Nosi allows course staffs to have full control over their class's IDE environment. This is accomplished by encrypting all homework files. Students must use the Nosi IDE to view the decrypted version of the files. The staff can choose to enable/disable different features of the IDE based on their course such as extensions. Nosi can also be used as an anti-cheating/anti-plagiarism tool. Nosi monitors all behavior *within* the IDE and keeps encrypted metadata as the student works on their assignments. When students submit their files, scripts and AI models are run on the metadata to flag suspicious behaviors. Since data is only collected within the IDE, students are free to use multiple devices to work on the assignment, use virtual machines (typically banned with other anti-cheating tools such as Honorlock), and perform normal behaviors on their computers without having any monitoring of any kind. On top of this functionality, Nosi also provides an AI assistant that can nudge students with helpful information when they're stuck on their assignments or explain course content. The tool was initially rolled out to CS 6601: Artificial Intelligence in Spring 2026.

Future Additions:
- Cloud hosted version of Nosi so students don't have to install any software on their machine if they choose not to
- Improving AI assistant
- Creating more staff tools for viewing plagiarism issues
